      <h3>We Keep Us Safe</h3>

<!--         
            <p>The earliest recorded stories of mankind have always connected us with a tribal experience. Passing down lessons learned from our mistakes and how we’ve thrived from our achievements has been key to societal preservation. Some of the first examples of documenting a people’s history can be found in cave drawings and stone etchings. Indigenous people tracked the movement of celestial bodies to remind them of epic battles of yesteryears or to find the perfect time to plant their precious crops, and with the advent of film photography in the early 1800s, reflections on our past became more precise and accurate.</p>
        
            <p>The emphasis put on these past renderings places the storyteller themselves in the hierarchy of a tribal community on par with the noblest of leaders. Their contributions will guide generations for years to come. They insert themselves into history and often are not actually a part of it. When social change is on the horizon, this becomes their call to action. When the human spirit says, “Enough is enough,” and the people spill out into the streets in protest, disrupting the system, the storytellers will grab their pen, typewriter, voice recorder, or in Shedrick Pelt’s case: his camera.</p>
         -->
            <p>Shedrick is a Washington D.C. based photojournalist. His work is largely connected to community and culture, and over the last year he has been stepping into history to document it from every angle. While marching with activists, attending rallies, and celebrating the defeat of fascist leaders, the war cry “We Keep Us Safe” has opened up his eyes to an integral part of this experience: holding space together against the powers that be.</p>
        
            <p>In the following pages of this photobook, you will retrace Shedrick’s shutter-clicks through American-history-in-the-making, on 35mm film, medium format film, and digital picture.</p>
