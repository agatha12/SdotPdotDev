            <p>


                I visited “The Big Smoke” for the day. Ok, really for 3 days but all I needed was one night totally
                immersed in London’s vibrant and energetic hip hop scene to really see what I’ve been missing. Stepping
                off the plane I was greeted by weather typical to the region: a cloudy sky in fifty shades of grey,
                winds slicing into your face at a buck fifty around every corner, and an overall gloomy cold that makes
                it easy to empathize with Amy Winehouse’s darkest moments. But, by the time I exited the Underground
                at Old Street the gloomy weather became a neutral backdrop to a bustling social hub. There was enough
                of a breeze in the air to cool me down from the stuffy subway ride and the claustrophobic hike up from
                underground. Classic London lingo seemed to roll out of every open doorway: “Bollocks you wanker!
                You’re taking the piss mate!” I made my way through the streets and the deeper I got into my
                surroundings
                the less the weather seemed to be there. I arrived at the Hoxton Gallery, the site of this evenings
                Art Meets Music jump-off, I’m greeted with, “Welcome mate,” and ushered in with a cordial “Cheers”.
                I can’t help but notice the stark contrast to the NYC bouncer looking at me like I’m in the wrong place.
                We may have fought for our independence from England hundreds of years ago, but today we should probably
                be fighting to bring back some of their cordiality and social charisma. Inside the love of art and
                culture
                resonates through every artist, photographer, creative, and patron buzzing around the room. Paintings of
                familiar faces adorn the walls: Biggie, Pac, and Bowie just to name a few. Down in the basement where
                the
                artists were performing there was enough energetic bodies to create a whole other humidity level.
                But in spite of how packed it was everyone in there was giving respect to the shooter as folks let me
                float around freely. Claps, snaps, and raucous “whoops” were echoing around the room after each artist’s
                set.
                The host even gave an artist a chance to walk us through a verse line for line letting the art truly
                take center stage. Big love! I can see why the Grime scene is embraced by a growing global audience.
                The way that these people were all dedicated to their culture and in love with it really had me thinking
                about snapping up a flat in Brighton so I could be a part of the excitement that lies ahead.
                Below are images that explain what words cannot. Enjoy.
