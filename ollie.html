            <p>


                    Our society constantly puts us in rooms full of people. And it can be hard living in a world and 
                    working in an industry where people are constantly climbing over each other to get ahead. 
                    But it has just become part of the process, and by some stretch of the imagination feels necessary. So you further isolate, hoping to shield yourself from the shock and awe of it all. And just when you feel like you’ll never meet anyone that understands your pain, an artist like Australian-born producer Ollie Roland runs across your path.  

                    I first experienced Ollie’s production style on Joeybagadonuts 2016 release ‘Labor of Love’. With his new-age-trap-rap-with-electronic-influences voice, Ollie crafted and curated every track with a creative and cohesive narrative flow.
                    
                    His eclectic style of production comes from a diverse collection of past and present musical heroes. “Michael Jackson captured everything for me as a child,” he tells me. With his father and brother opening doors to artist like Ace of Bass, Wu-Tang, and At The Drive, Ollie received a well rounded education of history’s musical landscape that ultimately informs the type of artist he works with today.
                    
                    When asked who are some of his favorite artist to work with, Alabama natives Dizzy D, Joeybagadonuts, and Supa are the first to come to mind. Theres also Miami’s Ruben Slikk on his 'Daisy Dukes’ track and Real Name Pryncess on 'Krabby Patty’. Also make sure you catch tracks with frequent collaborators Troy Boy and Maryland artist KD Bandz.
                    
                    The more and more this young man creates, the more we will realize his sonic genius. His yearning to travel outside his invisible boundaries resonates with me as a vagabond creative. And with that the fact that he traveled half-way around the world and connected with Block Beatazz Mali Boi tells me he will go far. I am confident that this artist with a Malaysian bloodline from Down Under will have an organic evolution to take his place as one of the most talented producers of our time.

                    ***We also wanted to dedicate this post to some homies we lost recently. [RIP] Troy Boy who was killed on Ollie’s birthday but still rides with him in spirit and Roy “Roosta Boi” Antonio one of the most talented people I’ve ever met.
