            <h3 id="pageHeader">Artist Spotlight: HeartBeatz (Munich, Germany)</h3>

            <p>


                    As the old saying goes, “we all do it for the love of money”, however, this is not the case for German born producer Florian “Heartbeatz” Wiesner. With artist like Bone Thugz & Devin the Dude blessing his beats Wiesner’s talents are proven and garnishing the attention of Industry standards.

                    By day, Florian creates beautiful soundscapes for major brands like BMW, Red Bull, Vans, and Hilton, just to name a few. By night, I imagine him as a key tickling, level-shaping Super Hero producing for Tech Nine’s whole Strange Music squad. Boasting five amazing tracks on RITTZ’ “Top of the Line” album, his work feels effortless. You get the sense that it was created by the moment, explicitly for the moment, as theme music to the moment. The exhibition of Santa Barbara artist Elliott Niezel’s “Code Talkers” was criminally slept on; together Wiesner and Niezel created a catalogue of work that transported the listener to sunny California in a topless low rider flipping switches.
              
                     I reckon we will continue to see more and more of the Nuremberg native in main stream music, but like I said: “this ain’t bout the money”… he’s just that damn good! Starting on the piano at 7 years old, music production has become his dedicated obsession. If he’s not at work, he’s in the lab; if he’s not in the lab, he’s at work. At both gigs, he’s constantly surrounded by the sound of snares, kicks, and drums. I think Drizzy said it best: “Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying I’m just here making all the music that they party to.”
              
                     Florian and I spent the afternoon pacing around Munich. The backdrop for our photo session was the beautiful Munich Residenz, a former royal palace of the Bavarian monarchs. It’s now open to visitors to see its architecture, room decorations, and displays from the former royal collections. Although I reached for my wallet for the ticket and lunch, he’d have none of that. Now that’s the homie: humble and hospitable. I think he’d fit in rather nicely in my home state of Alabama. Matter of fact, anytime he falls through, mama got a plate for him. I for one am rooting for this young man to get all the riches and shine that he deserves so that he can create for a life time, because he would love it, and not enough people like him win. Below are images of our rumblings around Munich. Cheers!
